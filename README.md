# Card Sorting

This project is a simple interface that presents a collection of animal cards. The animals are organized in three different ways to demonstrate multiple two-level hierarchy designs. Users can navigate between three tabs to explore the same animal data, each time organized under a different categorization scheme: Species, Age, and Size.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to organize the same set of information—in this case, animal data—into three different two-level hierarchical structures. Each tab shows a unique way to classify and access the same content, making it easier to understand how data organization affects usability and discoverability.

## Technologies Used

- Typescript
- React
- [Mantine UI Library](https://mantine.dev)

## Notes

This project is for educational purposes and demonstrates UI design with multiple classification systems. 
All data used is static and for demonstration only.
